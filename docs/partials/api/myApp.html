<div class="description"><div class="myapp-page"><p>myApp is a tool that automatically creates genereric grafical user interfaces for restful services 
produced by S-case. The application is basically based in the restful nature of the services, where 
every returnig resource,ecept it&#39;s properties, carrys a list with all the resources tha could be riched
from it. In addition to that, each one of the listed resources is bounded with one CRUD action. This means
that the application will know in every step what kind of action the user wills to make. Alongside with the
actual service the application uses a yaml file which has a detailed description af every resource. 
The combination of the current resource and the information stordes in the yaml file, makes the application
able to visualize the resource&#39;s data and implement every available CRUD action. </p>
