<div class="find"><div class="find-page"><p>This method is called from getObj() and request() functions. It uses the uri of the current
resource and the parsedTable, which has the information from the yaml file in a json format. 
S-case generates apis whose uris end with the name of the current resourse or with its id.
So after comparing the uri ending whith the information f the parsedTable, it can recognize 
the resourse an its properties. After that it creates a form object which is used to generate 
the form and will contain the values of the current resource. Then formType and formReq arrays 
are created to store the information about the type of the resource&#39;s properties and if they are 
required. Finally it calls the function passArguments().</p>
